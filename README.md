The latest headlines from the best of Knoxville

Knox'd is an aggregator of the latest information from the best of Knoxville's online media. All sites are hand-picked by the site managers, Casey Peters and Patrick Beeson.

This site is inspired by similar efforts from <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a> and <a href="http://popurls.com/">PopURLs</a> as well as the site formerly known as This is Roanoke. Site developer and designer Patrick Beeson wrote about the latter in a blog entry titled <a href="http://patrickbeeson.com/blog/2007/aug/24/create-your-own-news-site-with/">"Create your own news site with XML."</a>

Knox'd is developed in <a href="http://djangoproject.org">Django</a> and owes much to <a href="https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/tree/master/aggregator">the community aggregator source code</a> released on the Djangoproject Web site.
